                    <h2>Our story</h2>
                    <p>SmartRecipes was founded in 1967 by Gräsanden Gunnar II. At a time when food waste received
                        little attention, Gunnar recognized that large amounts of edible food were being thrown away
                        unnecessarily. He believed that better planning and more creative cooking could significantly
                        reduce this waste. What started as a personal effort soon developed into a company built around
                        responsible use of food.
                        <br><br>
                        The company has always been family run and the values established at its founding remain central
                        today. Leadership was later passed to Gunnar's son, Gräsanden Göran, who continues to guide
                        SmartRecipes with the same long term commitment. Under his direction, the company has grown
                        while staying true to its original purpose.
                        <br><br>
                        Food waste has become a major global problem with serious environmental and economic
                        consequences. SmartRecipes' long history gives the company a deep understanding of this issue.
                        For our family, reducing food waste is not a passing concern but a responsibility that has been
                        carried forward for generations.

                    <h2>Our goal</h2>
                    <p>Food waste is one of the most serious challenges in the modern food system. Every year, large
                        quantities of edible food are discarded, wasting natural resources and contributing to
                        environmental damage. At SmartRecipes, our goal is to help reduce this waste by supporting
                        smarter and more thoughtful cooking habits.
                        <br><br>
                        We create practical and flexible recipes that are designed to use ingredients people already
                        have at home. This includes leftovers, aging produce, and pantry items that are often forgotten.
                        Our recipes encourage simple adjustments rather than strict rules, making it easier for people
                        to reduce waste in everyday cooking.
                        <br><br>
                        Our goal is also to change how people think about food. By promoting better planning, greater
                        awareness, and respect for ingredients, we aim to support lasting habits that benefit both
                        households and the environment. Reducing food waste should be achievable, meaningful, and
                        enjoyable for everyone.
